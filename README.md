Ever had the problem that you needed a massive amount of steel?

If you had that problem, you probably also had the problem of the seriously long waiting time of the steel furnaces from some mods. This is especially annoying when you already have the required ressources and are simple forced to wait.

 

Simple Steel solves this problem by adding a furnaces that allows you to simply create steel from iron and coal. The steel can then be used in most other mods. Currently 1 steel requires 3 Coal und 2 Iron and takes 20 seconds to produce.
